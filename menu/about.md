I intend for this to be a technical blog that should be helpful to others getting started in deep learning. The topics will probably become more refined toward applying ML models for robotics since I'm excited about a future where robots assist humans in making life more enjoyable. This likely looks like a world where robots are imbued with world understanding (aligned with human interests) in order to handle labor-intensive and repetitive work in increasingly unconstrained environments. My career has taken me from working on hotel robots doing last-mile room-service delivery, to construction robots doing drywall finishing, to autonomous driving on public roads. At each step along the way, I've gained more appreciation for the challenges robotics systems face and I continue to enjoy the satisfaction of making robots work in general settings. I hope I'm able to pass on a taste of that satisfaction and perhaps spark some curiosity in the readers of this blog.
